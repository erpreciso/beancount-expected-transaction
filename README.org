* How To
** Install

Put ~expect.py~ somewhere on ~PYTHONPATH~, and put the following line
in your ledger.

#+begin_src python
  plugin "expect"  
#+end_src

** Setup expectations

Add metadata to the transaction you expect to repeat.

#+begin_src python
  2024-01-01 * "Beverages" "Recurrent weekly provision of soft drinks"
    expected: "True"
    frequency: "weekly"
    duration_in_years: 1
    E:Drinks                                       250 EUR
    L:Beverages
#+end_src

Metadata should resemble the ~dateutil.rrule~ parameters.
See [[https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rrule.html#dateutil.rrule.rrule][documentation]].

- frequency :: must be in the RFC 5545 names
  (https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc5545), otherwise default
  to monthly
- interval :: interval between expectations
- until OR count OR duration_in_years :: either end date, or number of
  expected occurrences. The two meta MUST NOT be given both in the
  same entry
  (https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rrule.html#dateutil.rrule.rrule)


Note that the transaction containing metadata cannot be de-duplicated;
it must be an actual transaction.
