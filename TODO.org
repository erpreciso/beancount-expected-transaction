* Additional features
- [ ] if end of expectations is approaching, add an error that
  forecasted are finishing
- [ ] implement more complex recurrences based on
  https://dateutil.readthedocs.io/en/stable/rrule.html#rrule-examples
* Logic
- [ ] Similar transactions must be within a certain range to be
  considered duplicates
- [ ] Create new transactions without the metadata
- [ ] Create new transactions using amount in metadata, and amount in
  postings = 0, to allow duplicate the original transaction versus an
  actual one
